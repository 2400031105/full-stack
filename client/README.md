# DonateNow React Client

This directory contains a minimal React (Vite) client for the DonateNow platform. It provides a login page that uses the server's `/api/auth` endpoints.

Quick start:

1. Change to the client folder:

```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173). Ensure the API server is running at http://localhost:3000.
